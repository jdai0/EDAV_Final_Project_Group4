<div style="text-align: left;">
In this interactive section, we aim to deepen our understanding of the demographics of different boroughs in NYC by exploring the topic of arrest types. Specifically, we want to determine whether the most prevalent arrest types differ across various boroughs in NYC. In the previous results section, we discussed arrest types in general, presenting every type in the dataset as a bar chart ranked from the highest to the lowest number of occurrences. We concluded that “Assault 3 & Related Offenses” significantly outnumbers other types, followed by "Petit Larceny" and "Felony Assault." However, different boroughs have diverse roots and histories, which might lead to different predominant crime types.

In addition to faceted bar plots, the conventional approach we will approach this problem, we choose to implement a set of interactive bar plots. By clicking a button representing a borough (or overview of NYC), a bar plot of arrest types corresponding to the borough will be drawn, accompanied by the faceted geographical distributions of crime instances. 

We implement this set of interactive plots for several reasons.

First, when hovering over a specific bar, the full name of arrest types (which could be too long to be fully incorporated in a normal bar chart) and the exact arrest numbers would be displayed, and the bar would be highlighted. This adds information without making the graph messy and hard to read. 

Second, putting geographic distribution alongside the interactive bar plots is helpful. It provides contextual insights to the bar plots through emphasizing where the borough in discussion is located on the scope of NYC, and how crimes within the borough is explicitly distributed. 

Lastly, this combination provides a basis for an interactive portfolio of crime analysis divided by boroughs, which could be a future working direction. Currently, we have only incorporated geographic information and Arrest Types due to the complexity of transforming data into readable form for javascript. However, with the flexibility of javascript functions, we could easily use them to create bar plots for other categorical variables. We could add new functions for other graph types and add textual descriptions, further enriching the portfolios. This would provide a thorough view for the differences of boroughs in terms of criminal activities.

From this graph, we find evidence supporting our earlier claim that different boroughs may have distinct predominant crime types. In Manhattan, the most common crime type is "Petit Felony," which refers to the theft of property with low value. With its small geographical area (as shown by the crime distribution map) and high population density, Manhattan provides an environment where theft can occur more easily, as the dense population offers camouflage for such activities. This could explain why Manhattan has a higher percentage of "Petit Felony" crimes. Additionally, the category "Vehicle and Traffic Laws" is not present in Manhattan, likely because the dense urban environment and transportation policies make driving a less preferred way of travel, which reduces traffic-related incidents.

We can also derive insights from Staten Island's data. The total number of crimes in each category is significantly lower than in other boroughs, which corresponds to the sparsely distributed dots shown on the map. However, Staten Island has a high proportion of "Vehicle and Traffic Laws" crimes. This could be attributed to its small population combined with an abundance of wide roads and express highways, which makes driving more common and increases the likelihood of traffic-related offenses.
