    "text": "1 Introduction\nOn November 8th, a man opened fire on an NYC subway, shooting the victim in the legs. The incident happened on the Upper West, not far from where we lived. Just 10 days later, three people were killed in random stabbing spree. The murderer, covered in blood, walked freely in the bustling streets in Manhattan before being arrested.\nWe live in a city that riffles with opportunities and danger at the same time. As data science students in NYC, both our own safety and the community we share are deeply intertwined with issues of public safety. In this project, we attempt to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on crimes in NYC as our means to raise awareness and contribute to the community.\nWe identified NYPD Arrest Data as our main data source, which includes information such as the type of crime, location, time, and suspect demographics. Although many crimes are deep-rooted, requiring massive investment and sacrifices to address, EDA could still yield valuable insight. By exploring social-economic correlations behind crimes, EDA could serve as a fundamental step for interventions and policy changes."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, the dataset we used is NYPD_Arrest_Data_Year_to_Date_.csv, which provides detailed records of arrests made by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) within the current year, specifically from 2024/01/01 to 2024/09/30. Each record includes information such as the type of crime, location, time, and suspect demographics, offering an opportunity to analyze trends in police enforcement activity.\n\nData Collection and Updates:\n\nOriginally collected and maintained by the NYPD, extracted and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning (OMAP), the primary evaluation and assessment arm and “think tank” of NYPD.\nUpdated quarterly.\n\nFormat and Dimensions:\n\nThe dataset is in CSV format.\nIt includes fields such as the arrest date, type and level of crime, location coordinates, and demographic details (e.g., age, race, sex).\n\nIssues/Problems:\n\nMissing values in certain fields due to historical changes in data collection forms or unavailable information at the time of reporting.\nGeo location data may not be accurate: data on certain arrests (e.g., those on moving trains or in parks) is approximated to nearby coordinates, and those arrests who were not able to be geo-coded have been located as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence.\nSome arrests do not have a specific law codes due to the huge amount of laws, so some records are categorized under generic or broad law codes (e.g., “LOC00000UM”).\nTranscription errors may result in inconsistencies in nominal data.\n\nData Import & Source:\n\nThe data was collected from NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) on Data.Gov (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date), which is a national open data platform that provides access to datasets published by agencies across the government.\nAs mentioned before, the dataset was actually rearranged and extracted from the original data & report from NYPD, but the original data is not publicly available by NYPD.\nConsidering that the data source Data.Gov is an official government data website, we have reason to believe in the authenticity and accuracy of the data."

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\n\nWe first take a look at what does the data look like and its structure:\n\n\nWe found that the raw dataset contains 195447 obs (rows) of 19 variables (cols), with more detailed variable information provided in the source website:\n\n\nARREST_KEY: Randomly generated persistent ID for each arrest\nARREST_DATE: Exact date of arrest for the reported event\nPD_CD: Three digit internal classification code (more granular than Key Code)\nPD_DESC: Description of internal classification corresponding with PD code (more granular than Offense Description)\nKY_CD: Three digit internal classification code (more general category than PD code)\nOFNS_DESC: Description of internal classification corresponding with KY code (more general category than PD description)\nLAW_CODE: Law code charges corresponding to the NYS Penal Law, VTL and other various local laws\nLAW_CAT_CD: Level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation\nARREST_BORO: Borough of arrest. B(Bronx), S(Staten Island), K(Brooklyn), M(Manhattan), Q(Queens)\nARREST_PRECINCT: Precinct where the arrest occurred\nJURISDICTION_CODE: Jurisdiction responsible for arrest. Jurisdiction codes 0(Patrol), 1(Transit) and 2(Housing) represent NYPD whilst codes 3 and more represent non NYPD jurisdictions\nAGE_GROUP: Perpetrator’s age within a category\nPERP_SEX: Perpetrator’s sex description\nPERP_RACE: Perpetrator’s race description\nX_COORD_CD: Midblock X-coordinate for New York State Plane Coordinate System, Long Island Zone, NAD 83, units feet (FIPS 3104)\nY_COORD_CD: Midblock Y-coordinate for New York State Plane Coordinate System, Long Island Zone, NAD 83, units feet (FIPS 3104)\nLatitude: Latitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326)\nLongitude: Longitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326)\nNew.Georeferenced.Column: Point coordinate in the form of (Longitude, Latitude)\n\n\nNow we investigate missing values:\n\n\n\nCode\nprint(missing_table)\n\n\n  Variable Missing_Count\n1    KY_CD            26\n2    PD_CD             6\n\n\n\nWe can see that most columns do not contain missing values, except for KY_CD and PD_CD, both of which are 3 digit internal classification code to categorize the type of the arrest, but the missing values only count for a tiny portion of the whole dataset.\nWe can then visualize the missing values using several graphs for clarity:\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for variables with missing values only\nmissing_summary_df$Missing_Proportion &lt;- missing_summary_df$Missing_Count / nrow(raw_data)\n\nmissing_summary_filtered &lt;- missing_summary_df |&gt;\n  filter(Missing_Proportion &gt; 0)\n\n# Horizontal bar plot for variables with missing values\nggplot(missing_summary_filtered, aes(x = reorder(Variable, -Missing_Proportion), y = Missing_Proportion)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"darkorange\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of Missing Values (Filtered)\", \n       x = \"Variable\", y = \"Proportion of Missing Values\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the proportion of missing values for variables that have missing data (PD_CD and KY_CD), highlighting that KY_CD has a slightly higher proportion of missing values compared to PD_CD, but both of which are extremely low overall.\n\n\n\nCode\n# use gg_miss_upset for UpSet graph\ngg_miss_upset(raw_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis UpSet Plot shows the intersection of missing values among the variables KY_CD and PD_CD: 6 records have missing values in both KY_CD and PD_CD; and KY_CD has 20 extra missing values in total.\nWe can also go further to investigate underlying pattern of missing values using other variables, e.g.: geographic location & demographic information.\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(missing_by_boro, aes(x = ARREST_BORO, y = Missing_Rate)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Rate by Borough\", x = \"Borough\", y = \"Missing Rate\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(missing_by_demo, aes(x = AGE_GROUP, y = Missing_Rate, fill = PERP_SEX)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Rate by Age and Sex\", x = \"Age Group\", y = \"Missing Rate\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))"

    "text": "2.3 Data Cleaning\n\nThere seems to be some slight pattern underlying the missing values, especially when we consider the the age variable, but as we mentioned in section 2.1, these missing values may due to historical changes in data collection forms or unavailable information at the time of reporting. Also, considering the extremely small percentage of missing values, we choose to directly delete all rows with missing values.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Remove all rows with missing values\ndata &lt;- na.omit(raw_data)\n\n# Check the number of rows before and after removing missing values\ncat(\"Number of rows before cleaning:\", nrow(raw_data), \"\\n\")\n\n\nNumber of rows before cleaning: 195447 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Number of rows after removing missing values:\", nrow(data), \"\\n\")\n\n\nNumber of rows after removing missing values: 195421 \n\n\nCode\n# Verify the data no longer contains missing values\ncat(\"Number of missing values:\", sum(is.na(data)), \"\\n\")\n\n\nNumber of missing values: 0 \n\n\n\nFor further analysis and visualization purpose, there are some variables that we can remove from the dataset and will not cause any inconvenience. Here are the reasons:\n\n\nARREST_KEY\nThis is a randomly generated unique identifier for each record. It does not carry any analytical or statistical value and is irrelevant for data analysis or visualization.\nY_COORD_CD & X_COORD_CD\nThese variables represent geographic coordinates in the NAD 1983 system. Since the dataset already includes Latitude and Longitude (which are more universally understood and used), these fields are redundant and were removed.\nLatitude & Longitude\nThese fields are redundant because the New.Georeferenced.Column variable already combines them into a (Longitude, Latitude) format. If geographic mapping is needed later, New.Georeferenced.Column will be sufficient.\nLAW_CODE\nThis variable contains detailed law codes, which have too many categories (1044 as seen from above) to be useful for most visualizations or analyses. Instead, the LAW_CAT_CD variable, which provides broader categories (felony, misdemeanor, violation), is more practical and will be used.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Remove unnecessary variables\ndata_cleaned &lt;- data |&gt;\n  select(-ARREST_KEY, -Y_COORD_CD, -X_COORD_CD, -LAW_CODE, -Latitude, -Longitude)\n\n\nWe then remove these variables:\n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Now there are:\", nrow(data_cleaned), \"rows and \", ncol(data_cleaned), \"columns. \\n\")\n\n\nNow there are: 195421 rows and  13 columns."
