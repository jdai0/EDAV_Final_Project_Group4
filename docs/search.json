    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nOn November 8th, a man opened fire on an NYC subway, shooting the victim in the legs. The incident happened on the Upper West, not far from where we lived. Just 10 days later, three people were killed in random stabbing spree. The murderer, covered in blood, walked freely in the bustling streets in Manhattan before being arrested. We live in a city that riffles with opportunities and danger at the same time. As data science students in NYC, both our own safety and the community we share are deeply intertwined with issues of public safety. In this project, we attempt to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on crimes in NYC as our means to raise awareness and contribute to the community.\nWe identified NYPD Arrest Data as our main data source, which includes information such as the type of crime, location, time, and suspect demographics. Although many crimes are deep-rooted, requiring massive investment and sacrifices to address, EDA could still yield valuable insight. By exploring social-economic correlations behind crimes, EDA could serve as a fundamental step for interventions and policy changes.\nWe proposed the following research questions:\nWhat are the most common types of arrests in NYC, and how are they distributed across different categories?\nHow do arrests vary geographically across the boroughs of NYC?\nWhat are the demographic profiles of individuals arrested, including age, gender, and race distributions?\nHow do arrest patterns change over time, and what temporal trends can be observed?"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, the dataset we used is NYPD_Arrest_Data_Year_to_Date_.csv, which provides detailed records of arrests made by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) within the current year, specifically from 2024/01/01 to 2024/09/30. Each record includes information such as the type of crime, location, time, and suspect demographics, offering an opportunity to analyze trends in police enforcement activity.\n\nData Collection and Updates:\n\nOriginally collected and maintained by the NYPD, extracted and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning (OMAP), the primary evaluation and assessment arm and “think tank” of NYPD.\nUpdated quarterly.\n\nFormat and Dimensions:\n\nThe dataset is in CSV format.\nIt includes fields such as the arrest date, type and level of crime, location coordinates, and demographic details (e.g., age, race, sex).\n\nIssues/Problems:\n\nMissing values in certain fields due to historical changes in data collection forms or unavailable information at the time of reporting.\nGeo location data may not be accurate: data on certain arrests (e.g., those on moving trains or in parks) is approximated to nearby coordinates, and those arrests who were not able to be geo-coded have been located as occurring at the police station house within the precinct of occurrence.\nSome arrests do not have a specific law codes due to the huge amount of laws, so some records are categorized under generic or broad law codes (e.g., “LOC00000UM”).\nTranscription errors may result in inconsistencies in nominal data.\n\nData Import & Source:\n\nThe data was collected from NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) on Data.Gov (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date), which is a national open data platform that provides access to datasets published by agencies across the government.\nAs mentioned before, the dataset was actually rearranged and extracted from the original data & report from NYPD, but the original data is not publicly available by NYPD.\nConsidering that the data source Data.Gov is an official government data website, we have reason to believe in the authenticity and accuracy of the data."

Since the dataset already includes Latitude and Longitude (which are more universally understood and used), these fields are redundant and were removed.\nLAW_CODE\nThis variable contains detailed law codes, which have too many categories (1044 as seen from above) to be useful for most visualizations or analyses. Instead, the LAW_CAT_CD variable, which provides broader categories (felony, misdemeanor, violation), is more practical and will be used.\n\nWe then remove these variables:\n\n\nCode\n# Remove unnecessary variables\ndata_cleaned &lt;- data |&gt;\n  select(-ARREST_KEY, -Y_COORD_CD, -X_COORD_CD, -LAW_CODE)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Now there are:\", nrow(data_cleaned), \"rows and \", ncol(data_cleaned), \"columns. \\n\")\n\n\nNow there are: 195421 rows and  15 columns."

Following closely are “Petit Larceny,” “Felony Assault,” and “Dangerous Drugs,” showcasing the focus on theft, violent crimes, and drug-related offenses.\nMeanwhile, the steep drop-off after these top offenses suggests that law enforcement resources are primarily concentrated on addressing these recurring issues. And interestingly, offenses like “Fortune Telling” appear at the bottom, reminding us that arrests span from the mundane to the severe in this bustling metropolis.\nNevertheless, while analyzing individual offenses provides granular insights into specific crime patterns, it is equally important to aggregate these offenses into broader categories to understand overarching trends and priorities in law enforcement.\nBy regrouping offenses into categories such as ‘Violent Crimes,’ ‘Property Crimes,’ and ‘Public Order Offenses,’ we can gain a more holistic view of the distribution and focus areas in NYC’s arrest records. The following visualization highlights these broader trends, offering a simplified yet insightful perspective — Violent Crimes & Physical Injury plus Property Crimes account for the vast majority of crimes, followed by Sex, Drug & Weapons related offenses, which is consistent with our previous rough finding!\nYou can refer to the code block below to see details about how do we reorganize the offense category.\n\n\nCode\ndata_regroup_ofs &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(crime_category = case_when(\n    OFNS_DESC %in% c(\"FELONY ASSAULT\", \"ARSON\", \"ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES\", \"JOSTLING\", \"RAPE\", \"CRIMINAL MISCHIEF & RELATED OF\", \"MURDER & NON-NEGL.

    "text": "3.2 Where are arrests concentrated in NYC?\nNow we’ve had an overview about what types of arrests are there and their distribution in the NYC. While the categorical breakdown of arrests sheds light on the types of crimes prevalent in NYC, understanding their geographic distribution offers crucial insights into where law enforcement efforts are most concentrated. By mapping arrests across the city’s boroughs, we aim to identify spatial patterns and hotspots of criminal activity, enhancing our perspective on urban safety dynamics.\n\n3.2.1 Is there a pattern by Boroughs in NYC?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = nyc_boroughs, aes(fill = boro_name), alpha = 0.8, \n          color = \"white\", size = 0.4) +\n  geom_point(data = data_geo, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), \n             color = \"darkgreen\", alpha = 0.45, size = 0.25) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Arrest Locations in NYC with Borough Boundaries\",\n    x = \"Longitude\",\n    y = \"Latitude\",\n    fill = \"Borough\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 16),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 30, hjust = 1),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.margin = margin(t = 2, r = 5, b = 2, l = 5)\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-74.25, -73.7), ylim = c(40.5, 40.92), expand = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nClusters are quite obvious to detect! Specifically, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx exhibit much densely populated for arrest locations than the other two boroughs, particularly in areas with high population density and economic activity.\nCareful readers may ask, why are there blank spaces among the clusters? Good question!\n\nThe empty space in the mid-Manhattan is one of New York’s famous landmarks - Central Park.\nAs for Brooklyn, it’s the Green-wood cemetery and hills region (Battle Hill, Quaker Hill, Breeze Hill, etc.)\nThen for Bronx, that’s the Bronx Zoo, Bronx Garden, and Fordham University, and Crotona Park.\n\nYou can find out these places in the dynamic heatmap below by yourself!\nIn comparison, Queens and Staten Island have relatively fewer arrests, but noticeable clusters emerge near major transit hubs and urban centers (e.g.: Flushing and Jamaica for Queens).\n\n\n3.2.2 Can we pinpoint to precincts level data?\nAfter viewing borough-level geographic distribution for our arrest data, why not dig deeper to see more details? Let’s do it!\nThe map below offers a dual-layer interactive visualization of NYC arrests location, capturing both the precinct-level arrest density and borough-wide boundaries. The heatmap highlights striking disparities across precincts, with intensely shaded areas revealing concentrated law enforcement activity or higher crime rates and light-colored areas possessing fewer crimes.\nBorough overlays, such as the expansive regions of Queens, help contextualize these precinct-level patterns, showcasing broader spatial dynamics. The inclusion of toggling options can help us to seamlessly switch between precinct-specific details and borough-wide overviews.\nKindly note for our readers: you can switch between Precincts and Boroughs option, but for better view, if you want to see information of both Borough and Precinct as well as the Borough border, CLICK Borough FIRST and THEN Precinct, then you when you can see something like the following (with the blue Borough showing as well) if you click that precinct:\n\nBorough: Queens\nPrecinct: 111\nNumber of Arrests: 697\n\n\n\nCode\nleaflet() |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  setView(lng = -73.95, lat = 40.7, zoom = 10) |&gt;\n  addPolygons(\n    data = nyc_precincts,\n    fillColor = ~colorNumeric(palette = \"YlOrRd\", domain = nyc_precincts$Offense_Count)(Offense_Count),\n    color = \"black\",\n    weight = 1,\n    fillOpacity = 0.6,\n    group = \"Precincts\",\n    popup = ~paste0(\n      \"Borough: \", boro_name, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"Precinct: \", precinct, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"Number of Arrests: \", Offense_Count\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  addPolygons(\n    data = nyc_boroughs,\n    color = \"blue\",\n    weight = 2,\n    fillOpacity = 0,\n    group = \"Boroughs\",\n    popup = ~paste0(\"Borough: \", boro_name)\n  ) |&gt;\n  addLayersControl(\n    overlayGroups = c(\"Precincts\", \"Boroughs\"),\n    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  addLegend(\n    position = \"bottomright\",\n    pal = colorNumeric(palette = \"YlOrRd\", domain = nyc_precincts$Offense_Count),\n    values = nyc_precincts$Offense_Count,\n    title = \"Number of Arrests\",\n    opacity = 1\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you find something different from what we saw in previous plot? — There is!\nFor example, previously, we thought that Manhattan is full of crime activities due to the densely plotted green dots, but what we can detect from interactive plot here shows a different story. Why?\nWell, the new interactive plot reveals a higher perceived density of arrest locations compared to the static plot from above, even in areas previously thought to be sparse. This difference arises primarily because the static density plot aggregates points into heat zones, emphasizing high-concentration areas and potentially de-emphasizing outliers or less dense regions. In contrast, the interactive plot retains individual arrest points, making low-density areas visually more prominent and providing a more granular representation of spatial distribution.\nAdditionally, the interactive map overlays precinct and borough boundaries, which further contextualizes and redistributes attention across regions, especially in areas like Queens and Staten Island, where arrests may appear sparse in a heatmap but have distinct localized clusters in the new plot. This highlights the value of combining point-level data with boundary layers to uncover hidden spatial patterns."

This consistency might indicate stable law enforcement activity or consistent crime patterns throughout the year.\nTo find out more granular information, we can look at the weekday data:\nThe boxplot reveals significant variations in arrest counts by weekday:\n\nArrests peak on Wednesdays and Thursdays and then gradually decrease, reaching their lowest on Sundays.\nSuch pattern seems to be counter-intuitive: since weekends typically see more public activities and gatherings, which could increase opportunities for certain crime activities.\nThe lower arrest numbers on weekends might instead reflect reduced law enforcement activity or reporting delays, and such trend may continue till Monday.\nConversely, the midweek peaks could be tied to targeted enforcement operations or routine patrols that are more active during weekdays.\n\nIs such pattern really the case? We’re not sure, let’s move forward to uncover more information!\n\n\n3.4.2 Daily Pattern\nTo dive deeper, we can explore the data in a daily manner.\n\n\nCode\narrests_plot &lt;- ggplot(daily_data, aes(x = ARREST_DATE)) +\n  # Line for daily counts\n  geom_line(aes(y = Count, color = \"Daily Count\"), size = 0.4) +  \n  # Smooth trendline\n  geom_smooth(aes(y = Count, color = \"Trendline\"), method = \"loess\", \n              formula = y ~ x, span = 0.3, size = 1, se = FALSE) + \n  # Rolling average line\n  geom_line(aes(y = Rolling_Avg, color = \"7-Day Rolling Avg\"), size = 1) +\n  # Highlight high and low points\n  geom_point(data = filter(daily_data, Count &gt; quantile(Count, 0.9)), \n             aes(y = Count, color = \"Top 10%\"), size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = filter(daily_data, Count &lt; quantile(Count, 0.1)), \n             aes(y = Count, color = \"Bottom 10%\"), size = 2) +\n  # Define colors and labels for legend\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"Legend\",  \n    values = c(\n      \"Daily Count\" = \"black\",\n      \"Trendline\" = \"orange\",\n      \"7-Day Rolling Avg\" = \"green\",\n      \"Top 10%\" = \"red\",\n      \"Bottom 10%\" = \"blue\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"1 month\",  \n    date_labels = \"%Y-%m\"     \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Arrests by Day\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Arrests\"\n  ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",  \n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\ninteractive_arrests_plot &lt;- ggplotly(arrests_plot)\n\ninteractive_arrests_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph takes us on a journey through daily arrests in 2024, revealing intriguing patterns and seemingly regular extreme values.\n\nThe Black Line (Daily Count): Captures the raw, day-to-day pulse of arrests, showing dramatic spikes and dips that hint at the impact of events, enforcement strategies, or even social behavior.\nThe Orange Line (Trendline): A smoothed path that whispers the bigger picture—arrests started strong but trended downward as the year progressed. Could this reflect changing crime rates, seasonal effects, or something more unexpected?\nThe Green Line (7-Day Rolling Average): Smoothing out the chaos, this line unveils weekly rhythms in arrest patterns, helping us spot recurring cycles that would otherwise be lost in the noise. (recall what we just got in the weekly analysis, which matches what we get here!)\nThe Red Dots (Top 10% Days): These mark the “what-happened-there” moments—days with exceptionally high arrests. Were these driven by large-scale events, policy shifts, or targeted crackdowns? They beg for a deeper dive.\nThe Blue Dots (Bottom 10% Days): On the flip side, these quieter days suggest reduced activity, possibly tied to weekends, holidays, or other lulls in enforcement.\n\nThis layered visualization doesn’t just show the data—it sparks curiosity. What caused those peaks? Why the downward trend?\nLet’s investigate it now:\n\n\nCode\n# Plot with corrected weekday order and consistent colors\nextreme_weekday &lt;- ggplot(extreme_days, aes(x = Weekday, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", aes(y = ..count..)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors, name = \"Category\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Weekday Distribution of Extreme Arrest Days\",\n    x = \"Weekday\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 14)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Plot with distinct legends for smoothing lines and bar colors\nextreme_month &lt;- ggplot(extreme_days_summary, aes(x = Month, y = Count)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill = Category), stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_smooth(\n    data = extreme_days_summary |&gt; filter(Category == \"Bottom 10%\"),\n    aes(x = as.numeric(Month), y = Count, color = \"Bottom 10%\"),\n    formula = y ~ x, method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, span = 0.5, size = 1\n  ) +\n  geom_smooth(\n    data = extreme_days_summary |&gt; filter(Category == \"Top 10%\"),\n    aes(x = as.numeric(Month), y = Count, color = \"Top 10%\"),\n    formula = y ~ x, method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, span = 0.5, size = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Bottom 10%\" = \"blue\", \"Top 10%\" = \"red\"),\n    name = \"Bar Category\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Bottom 10%\" = \"skyblue\", \"Top 10%\" = \"violet\"),\n    name = \"Smoothing Line\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Monthly Distribution of Extreme Arrest Days\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 14)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Combine the two plots with patchwork\ncombined_extreme_plot &lt;- extreme_weekday / extreme_month + \n  plot_layout(heights = c(1, 1)) + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Analysis of Extreme Arrest Days by Weekday and Month\",\n    theme = theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.4),\n      plot.margin = margin(t = 10, r = 10, b = 10, l = 10)\n    )\n  )\n\n# Display the combined plot\ncombined_extreme_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the weekday extreme_day distribution:\n\nwe can perceive a clear distinction in the patterns of extreme arrest days (top 10% and bottom 10%) across the week. The bottom 10% arrest days are highly concentrated on weekends, especially Sundays. Conversely, top 10% arrest days peak sharply on Wednesdays and Thursdays, indicating potentially heightened law enforcement operations or higher crime incidences during mid-week. This corresponds with our previous findings!\n\nWhile if we extend the timeline to a monthly manner:\n\nThe top 10% arrest days exhibit a cyclical trend, with clear peaks around February and May-June, followed by noticeable dips in other months. This cyclicality may correspond to factors such as seasonal events, weather patterns, or heightened social activities that influence crime rates or arrests during these months.\nOn the other hand, the bottom 10% arrest days peak in January, March-April, and September, potentially aligning with quieter periods in terms of both criminal activity and law enforcement engagement. The dip in the middle of the year (particularly June) might reflect increased law enforcement activity focused on handling higher crime rates, leaving fewer “low arrest” days.\nIndeed, from the previous monthly pattern analysis, there seem to be slight variations for number of arrests across 2024’s first 9 months, but from the plot we just got, we can possibly deduce that there may be at least some pattern for the number of arrest peak vs. valley days!\n\nTo quickly wrap up, this section delves into NYC’s arrest data, exploring what types of arrests dominate, where they happen most, who is involved, and how patterns shift through time. From striking demographic disparities to geographic hotspots, our visualizations—histograms, bar charts, bubble charts, heatmaps, and time-series analysis—shed light on patterns that shape the city’s dynamics and offer a fresh perspective on the data."

    "text": "4.1 NYC Crime Distribution by Borough\n\n\n\n  Manhattan\n  Bronx\n  Brooklyn\n  Queens\n  Staten Island\n  NYC Overview\n\n\n\n  \n    Select a borough to view the crime distribution.\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this interactive section, we aim to deepen our understanding of the demographics of different boroughs in NYC by exploring the topic of arrest types. Specifically, we want to determine whether the most prevalent arrest types differ across various boroughs in NYC. In the previous results section, we discussed arrest types in general, presenting every type in the dataset as a bar chart ranked from the highest to the lowest number of occurrences. We concluded that “Assault 3 & Related Offenses” significantly outnumbers other types, followed by “Petit Larceny” and “Felony Assault.” However, different boroughs have diverse roots and histories, which might lead to different predominant crime types.\nIn addition to faceted bar plots, the conventional approach we will approach this problem, we choose to implement a set of interactive bar plots. By clicking a button representing a borough (or overview of NYC), a bar plot of arrest types corresponding to the borough will be drawn, accompanied by the faceted geographical distributions of crime instances.\nWe implement this set of interactive plots for several reasons.\nFirst, when hovering over a specific bar, the full name of arrest types (which could be too long to be fully incorporated in a normal bar chart) and the exact arrest numbers would be displayed, and the bar would be highlighted. This adds information without making the graph messy and hard to read.\nSecond, putting geographic distribution alongside the interactive bar plots is helpful. It provides contextual insights to the bar plots through emphasizing where the borough in discussion is located on the scope of NYC, and how crimes within the borough is explicitly distributed.\nLastly, this combination provides a basis for an interactive portfolio of crime analysis divided by boroughs, which could be a future working direction. Currently, we have only incorporated geographic information and Arrest Types due to the complexity of transforming data into readable form for javascript. However, with the flexibility of javascript functions, we could easily use them to create bar plots for other categorical variables. We could add new functions for other graph types and add textual descriptions, further enriching the portfolios. This would provide a thorough view for the differences of boroughs in terms of criminal activities.\nFrom this graph, we find evidence supporting our earlier claim that different boroughs may have distinct predominant crime types. In Manhattan, the most common crime type is “Petit Felony,” which refers to the theft of property with low value. With its small geographical area (as shown by the crime distribution map) and high population density, Manhattan provides an environment where theft can occur more easily, as the dense population offers camouflage for such activities. This could explain why Manhattan has a higher percentage of “Petit Felony” crimes. Additionally, the category “Vehicle and Traffic Laws” is not present in Manhattan, likely because the dense urban environment and transportation policies make driving a less preferred way of travel, which reduces traffic-related incidents.\nWe can also derive insights from Staten Island’s data. The total number of crimes in each category is significantly lower than in other boroughs, which corresponds to the sparsely distributed dots shown on the map. However, Staten Island has a high proportion of “Vehicle and Traffic Laws” crimes. This could be attributed to its small population combined with an abundance of wide roads and express highways, which makes driving more common and increases the likelihood of traffic-related offenses."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Key findings\n\nIn the introduction section, we outlined several research questions we aimed to explore. Here, we present our insights gained through thorough exploratory data analysis.\nThe most common arrest type in NYC is “Assault 3 & Related Offenses,” reflecting the prevalence of physical altercations in the city. Other frequent offenses include “Petit Larceny” and “Felony Assault.” However, each borough may differs in specifics. For example, “Petit Larceny” is the most common crime type.\nGeographic clusters are quite obvious to detect. Specifically, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx exhibit densely populated arrest locations, compared to Queens and Staten Island.\nArrests shown extremely disproportionate distributions across different demographic groups. A majority of suspects are aged 25-44, predominantly male, with notable racial disparities, including 46.6% Black individuals and 26.7% White individuals.\nThere are significant variations in arrests by weekday, peaking midweek (Wednesdays and Thursdays) and dropping to their lowest on Sundays, reflecting reduced law enforcement activity on weekends. Monthly trends show cyclical peaks in February and May-June, driven by seasonal or social factors, with quieter periods in January, March-April, and September. Over the year, arrests trended downward, while the green 7-day rolling average highlights recurring weekly patterns.\n\nLimitations and future directions\n\nWe encountered challenges when attempting to visualize precinct-level data. The given dataset alone lacked sufficient information to effectively map precincts. To address this, we utilized the NYC Open Data API to extract additional data for more thorough analysis.\nAs outlined in the Interactive Graph section, our goal is to build an interactive portfolio for crime analysis across NYC boroughs. However, due to the technical complexity of transforming data into JavaScript-friendly formats, we have yet to integrate other categorical data into the visualizations. Initially, we planned to include an interactive geographic distribution map but, constrained by our limited experience with JavaScript, we opted to use static images generated from result.qmd instead.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe data highlights significant disparities in arrests based on age, race, and gender, with young adults (25-44), males, and Black individuals being disproportionately represented. This underscores the need to examine systemic factors, such as social-economical structures, influencing these trends.\nWeekday and monthly arrest patterns reveal that law enforcement and criminal activity are not evenly distributed over time. For instance, midweek peaks and weekend lows suggest differences in law enforcement strategies. This insight could guide better resource allocation to lower crime rates and prevent abscond.\nDifferent boroughs may have distinct predominant crime types, reflecting the physical and economic disparities between these areas. This presents an excellent opportunity for more in-depth research and analysis.\nNavigating html and javascript for our interactive graph presents new challenges, such as debugging the image path for our embedded images. However, it’s also a fruitful experience that honed our problem-solving ability."
